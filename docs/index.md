# Project Documentation

This directory contains supplementary documentation for the **Trends Library** project.

The following materials should be added here over time:

- **OpenAPI specification** (JSON or YAML) describing the REST endpoints exposed by the FastAPI server.
- **Architecture diagrams** crafted with [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) or similar tools illustrating component interactions, data flows and deployment topologies.
- **Additional guides**, tutorials or notes explaining system setup, configuration, and operational procedures.

Feel free to add new Markdown files or subdirectories to organise the documentation as the project evolves.
